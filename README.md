ðŸ©º BioRythm â€“ AI-Powered Wearable Health Monitor

BioRythm is a smart wearable designed to provide real-time, clinically accurate biosignal monitoring.

It uses medical-grade sensors integrated on a compact, low-power platform powered by an ESP32S microcontroller.

Three AD8232 ECG modules simulate a 3-lead ECG setup, capturing data from 9 points for better cardiac accuracy.

MAX30102 monitors heart rate and SpOâ‚‚; MPU6500 tracks motion for posture, activity, and sleep analysis.

Data is preprocessed using filters and peak detection algorithms and transmitted wirelessly via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.

Real-time graphs of ECG, heart rate, and SpOâ‚‚ are displayed on a mobile or web dashboard.

AI models (e.g., LSTM, SVM) classify arrhythmias, detect stress, and predict potential cardiac anomalies.

Subscription-based model: weekly plans for patients and monthly analytics dashboard access for doctors.

Ideal for hospitals, defense forces, elderly care centers, and athletes.

Compared to smartwatches, it offers real ECG signal quality, modular sensor support, and offline syncing.

Designed with future integration of thermoelectric energy harvesting to minimize environmental impact.

Compact, rechargeable, and OTA-updatable hardware ensures long lifecycle and low maintenance.

Secure transmission protocols ensure HIPAA-compliant patient data protection.

Offers a scalable and sustainable solution to bridge wearable tech and medical-grade diagnostics.
